Your task is to extract structured data from a candidate's resume, which may be presented in various formats. Focus on identifying and interpreting content based on its meaning and context, rather than relying on specific section headers or layouts.

Extract the following fields:

- skills: An array of strings representing the candidate's technical skills.
  - Include programming languages, frameworks, libraries, tools, platforms, and services that the candidate has demonstrably used.
  - Exclude vague terms (e.g., "blockchain") unless accompanied by specific technologies (e.g., "Solidity").
  - Normalize names (e.g., "AWS Lambda" â†’ "Lambda") to avoid redundancy.
  - Avoid listing soft skills or general concepts.

- experience: A list of job entries, each containing:
  - title: Job title.
  - company: Company name.
  - start_date: Start date in 'YYYY-MM' format.
  - end_date: End date in 'YYYY-MM' format or 'Present'.
  - duration_months: Total months between start and end dates.

- total_experience_years: Total professional experience, rounded to one decimal place.

- career_level: One of ['entry', 'mid', 'senior', 'executive'], based on experience and job titles.

- category: One of ['engineer/developer', 'designer', 'business development', 'human resources and people operations', 'developer relations'], based on the candidate's background.

- summary: A concise paragraph summarizing the candidate's profile.

Guidelines:

1. Analyze the resume holistically, interpreting content based on context and meaning.
2. Extract skills that are explicitly mentioned and demonstrably used by the candidate.
3. Calculate experience metrics and classify career level logically.
4. For the summary:
   - Synthesize the candidate's professional background, highlighting key skills, notable achievements, and areas of expertise.
   - Provide insights into the candidate's career trajectory, strengths, and potential value to prospective employers.
   - Keep the summary concise, informative, and aligned with the extracted data.
5. Adhere strictly to the specified schema. Do not include additional fields or formatting.
6. Output only plain text. Do not use markdown formatting, including asterisks, hashes, or backticks.
